# Live-Peers

## VISION

Enable real-time, peer-to-peer participation and sharing of content.

### Relevant scenarios in FAC
+ Presentations from external speakers
+ Project show & tells, whether this is from alumni or students
+ Workshops - during curriculum from internal mentors
+ Code alongs
+ Sharing internal mentoring sessions
+ Business meetings

#### Problems
Sharing presentations/workshops (across campuses)

Enabling participation:
+ Q & A - Can't put your hand up and be noticed by the presenter/mentor if you're not physically in the room
+ Voting - Coming through text chat makes it difficult to count
+ Screen Sharing - Presentations and code alongs - don't have any control over which tab/window the presenter is on or whether they are going to fast for you
